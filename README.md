# Celsius-to-fahrenheit-converter

My first Javascript project. 
Basic interface with 3 buttons. 
First button, "konwertuj", converts written in input amount of degrees of Celsius to degrees of Fahrenheit. 
Second button - "resetuj" delete all texts in input and below. 
Third button - "zamie≈Ñ" changes value in spans with classes "one" and "two" to its opposite, then, if you click first button, degrees of Fahrenheit it is going to be changed to degrees of Celsius.
